If you don't want to create a jar, a quick method for compilation is save the .java files and the books_of_bible folder (including all the .txt files) into a folder and compile with: "javac -d . *.java"   //don't include the quotation marks. Then run with "java biblereader.BibleReader" //without the quotes
